# Policy Responses to Food Price Inflation in India and Egypt 

## Abstract

Food price inflation poses serious threat to global food security and economic stability. This paper examines Egypt’s wheat subsidy program and India’s rice export ban as government responses to keep the recent cases (2019-2024) food price inflation at bay in the two countries induced by climate shocks and geopolitical upheavals. Egypt increased subsidies to keep bread affordable, easing the burden on consumers but straining government finances. India restricted rice exports to stabilize domestic prices, benefiting local consumers but disrupting global markets. While both responses offer short-term relief, they could create mid-to long-term challenges. Policymakers must prioritize internationally coordinated efforts to mitigate spillover effects of their policies to ensure equitable food security in an era of increasing global food system volatility.

## 1.0	Introduction

The global food system has become increasingly fragile in recent years due to climate shocks, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions. Between 2022 and 2023, events like the Russia-Ukraine war and El Niño-induced droughts exposed the vulnerabilities of countries dependent on food imports or single-crop agriculture (World Bank, 2024). Food prices surged dramatically during this period, with global food inflation rising by 11% year-on-year (World Bank, 2024) (See Figure 1). This inflation posed a major challenge to economic stability and food security, especially in developing nations.

This paper compares the policy responses of Egypt and India; two countries significantly affected by rising food prices. Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, increased subsidies to keep bread affordable after wheat prices spiked by 44% due to disruptions from the Black Sea region (Reuters, 2023). In contrast, India, the world’s top rice exporter, imposed export restrictions to protect domestic supplies amid climate-driven shortages. This move stabilized domestic prices but caused global rice prices to rise by 15–20%, impacting international markets (Joseph and Abdullah, 2023). Thus, this paper highlights the strengths and weaknesses of these policy choices and explores how governments can better balance short-term relief with long-term food system resilience
